description: An account of what I learned when I investigated applying TailWind to this Blog.

It all started with a colleague's recommendation that I use Tailwind and PostCSS together to style content. Initially I ignored it but TailWind kept on creeping back into conversations. The most recent occurred while attending a Egghead Zoom conference when Ken Dodds mentioned that he would include only Tailwind in his styling section for the Updated React for Beginners course on Egghead. Taylor Bell sent out a link to a [collection of videos](https://egghead.io/playlists/introduction-to-tailwind-and-the-utility-first-workflow-0b697b10) by Tailwind's creator - Adam Wathan.

## Setup

Tailwind is a PostCSS plugin. PostCSS is not a transpiler like SASS but a gateway for using JavaScript with CSS via plugins.
